Customized Firware for cheap chinese ip-camera with GM8135S chipset

Most of the GM8135S cameras usually come with a firmware V4.02.R12.00017502.10010.042399.00000 
As the problem with this firmware is that it does not have a web-interface or has any alternative way to 
update firware or change settings, it makes the camera quite useless.

I created a modified firmware (based on base image: General_HZXM_IPC_GM8135S__50V10PL-S_V4.02.R12.Nat.OnvifS..20160407.bin) which opens a 
telnet service on port 23 and enables a web-interface, so the camera can be configured and accessed.

to upload the modified files you need to connect via UART (located on the 3 blamk connection pins on top of the camera board)

once connected through UART and you can see the boot process, disrupt boot (camera ip will be 192.168.1.10)

start a tftp server on ip 192.168.1.107 and serve the xxx.cramfs.img files on a pc


on the camera enter the following (at the uboot prompt):

# setenv appSystemLanguage English;setenv bootdelay 5;saveenv



and install main modified firmware files:

# tftp 0x2000000 custom.cramfs.img;flwrite;tftp 0x2000000 user_web.cramfs.img;flwrite



if you need a full restore/recovery 
important note : uboot (on partition mtd0) must still work !! otherwise camera will be dead and can not be recovered !


# tftp 0x2000000 custom.cramfs.img;flwrite;tftp 0x2000000 romfs-x.cramfs.img;flwrite;tftp 0x2000000 user-web.cramfs.img;flwrite;tftp 0x2000000 web-x.cramfs.img;flwrite
